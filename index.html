    <h2>Snipers</h2>
    <p>At the time of making this website it is Chapter 2 Season 4, So there can be changes to the game by the time you read this but at the moment there are 2 snipers in the game. One being the Suppressed sniper rifle the other being the Bolt Action sniper</p>
 <h3>Suppresed Sniper</h3>

    <p>The Suppresed Sniper comes in two rarities: Epic and Legendary. the epic Suppressed sniper does 95 damage to the body with a instant kill 252 damage shot. The legendary Suppressed Sniper does 100 damage to the body and does 262 damage to the head. The epic rariety sniper has a reload time 1.9 seconds, and the legendary sniper has a reload time of 1.8. It is not easy tp find usually requiring a master chest, supply drop or very rarely a normal chest. People prefer the Bolt Action Sniper to the suppresed sniper because it has heavier damage and it is <strong>a lot</strong> easier to find but the look is worth it it has the shortest reload time of any sniper not vaulted at the time. </p> 
<h3>Bolt Action</h3>

<p> The Bolt Action sniper is the only sniper which is not vaulted except for the Suppresed Sniper it comes in three rarities:<strong>Rare, Epic</strong> and <strong>Legendary</strong> The rare bolt action sniper does 105 to the body from any distance which will kill any player who has no shield on him while the haedshot is any where between 210 damage which is an instant kill for any player in the match except for some computer proggrammed bosses who have around 400 to 500 health. The epic version of this sniper is alot powerful than its rare counterpart it does 110 damage to the body which will also kill any unshielded players and the headshot does 216 damage which will delete any plyer on the game. </p>
